# Raqqa in the Popular Imagination: Projecting Attitudes Toward Place Over Time
![](https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/raqqa.png)

A short description / abstract of the topic you choose. For the text here and below, feel free to use **bold** and *italic* fonts, [linked texts](url),  ![images](url), or any other element you think would be helpful for your audience to understand the topic.

Utilizing research methods learned over the course of the next ten weeks, I aim to compile *textual and image data* which can be projected and understood within the context of a dynamic civil war - with key shifts in front lines and other major events allowing for time sensitive contextualization.

In working toward this end I hope to understand **how emotional attachment to place can change over the course of a conflict**. Though results may be somewhat skewed by internal displacement and speech restriction - particularly under ISIS - it will be insightful to understand how dissidents and loyal citizens of different political projects can align and differ with relation to one place.


## Textual Data

Textual data can primarily be gathered through the use a web-crawling bot which identifies geotagged posts on Facebook and Twitter - sites which have been integral to what Lynch, Freelon, and Aday term *'Syria's Socially Mediated Civil War'* (Lynch et al., 2014). I will be excluding Youtube as a source despite its popularity for the fact that it is not readily suited toward the collection of textual data.

Through use of Natural Language Processing references to or descriptions of Raqqa in text can be processed to understand the emotional attachment to and attitude toward Raqqa as a place by its differing populations.

## Image Data

Aforementioned textual data can be paired with images based on popular use. Recurrance of the same image across multiple accounts identified with Raqqa can be used to determine and understand popular understandings of what it has been, is, and could be.

## Geospatial Contextualization

In order to more intimately capture the connection between conflict and place-feeling I believe that by integrating previous data with place-specific incident and area control data compiled by [OSINT researchers](https://www.bellingcat.com/tag/syria/) and [conflict tracking organizations](https://www.cartercenter.org/peace/conflict_resolution/syria-conflict-resolution.html#reports).

The aim of this connection is to explore the connection between urban fragility and place-feel as well as how different citizen groups have experienced Raqqa under competing systems of control.
